# Docker Engine
Docker is a widely used containerization technology that allows developers to package applications into isolated
containers. The Docker engine is the core component of the Docker architecture that makes containerization 
possible. In this repo we'll explore the architecture of the Docker engine and how it works.

The Docker engine is made up of several components, including:
- Docker daemon
- containerd
- runc.
