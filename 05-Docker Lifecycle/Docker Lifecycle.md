# Docker Lifecycle
Docker has become a widely used method for packaging and running applications. To work with Docker efficiently,
it is essential to comprehend the various stages of a container's existence, which is called its `lifecycle`.
The Docker container lifecycle is comprised of several states, such as `created`, `running`, `paused`, `exited`, 
and `dead`. In this repo we will examine each of these states in detail and explore what they represent and
when a container enters each state. By understanding these stages, we will have a better grasp of how to work 
with Docker containers.
