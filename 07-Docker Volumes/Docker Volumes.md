# Docker Volumes
Docker volumes provide persistent storage for Docker containers. Volumes can be attached to containers, 
allowing data to be shared and stored outside the container's lifecycle. Volumes are used to manage data
that needs to be retained even if the container is deleted or replaced. This makes them ideal for maintaining
important data across container deployments.
